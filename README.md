**cadence** is [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) software, with functionality similar to sites like [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/home). Users have their own "home server" where they can submit song listens, status updates, and even create comments on user profiles, which are all federated across the Internet. Powered by [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/), **cadence** is intended to be another step in revitalizing the decentralized web.

Heavily inspired by [libre.fm](https://libre.fm/)!
